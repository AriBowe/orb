orb.py Rewrite
------------------------------

Orb is a discord bot I made several years ago for the SMACK UQ
Discord server (and for fun). I've been gradually improving on
it and trying to clean it up since the initial release, but
frankly the codebase is a mess and I think it's time to start
again. This is a clean-slate rebuild of the bot.

Previously I accepted PRs as long as they looked right, but
I've decided that from Rewrite onwards I won't be accepting
code submissions. This is partially because I felt the goal of
the bot was moving away from what I wanted, partially so I can
use this as an (admittedly simple) sample of my work, and 
partially because it's my bot and I can do what I want.

I do still take suggestions, so feel free to send me any!
