orb.py - A useless discord bot
------------------------------

Orb is a discord bot I made for the SMACK UQ
discord server (and for fun).
Feel free to add it to any server you want.

Feature docs can be found at https://aribowe.github.io/orb

I host my bot on a cheap hosthatch server,
however it should run on any local machine. To host
your own instance, replace the string in the config
file with your own bot token. If you have any 
requests or comments, send me a message at xiiiâ„¢#0013
on discord.
