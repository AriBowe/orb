ORB.py - A useless discord bot
------------------------------

ORB is a discord bot I made for the SMACK UQ
discord server (and for fun).
Feel free to add it to any server you want.

REQURIES:
- python 3.x.x
- discord.py (running 1.1.1)
- random.py (normally preinstalled)
- a discord bot instance

I host my bot on a free tier AWS server,
however it should run on any local machine. To host
your own instance, replace the string in the last
line of code with your own bot token. If you
have any requests or comments, send me a message at
xiiiâ„¢#0013.
